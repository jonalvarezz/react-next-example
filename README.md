# React Next Example

This a sample API that uses React@next (16.6.2) to create a similar architecture as Redux using `React.Context` and `React.useReducer`.

Read more about it in my blog post entry: [Replacing Redux with React's useReducer and Context](http://jonalvarezz.com/articles/replacing-redux-with-usereducer-context/)

Also features:

- React Hooks
- React Context
- Styled Components
- React Spring
- Prettier

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn`

Installs project dependencies

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
